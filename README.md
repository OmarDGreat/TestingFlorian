## Installation

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the `app` folder and the web-page<br>
loads on localhost. You can also follow the deployed link below.


## Usage

Since this is my portfolio page there are two possible usages.<br>
<br>
You can load the page or follow the link and the web page tells you about me<br>
and my skill-set<br>
The other option is to use the app as a template for an own REACT portfolio page.
